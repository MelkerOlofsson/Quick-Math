This project was created by Lina Lyricsen, Melker Olofsson, Ahmad Soukkar, and Victor Andersson. It's a project made in Vue + Vite for our courses in 'JavaScript with the use of a framework' and 'Agile Development'.

It's a website created to help people learn and develop their skills in mathematics. Due to limitations in time we had to limit our ambitious ideas a bit, but it didn't stop us to create what we set out to do.

The final project is a Quiz (in addition) with three different difficulties as well as a 'challenge mode'. If you decide to check out the website however, I do recommend trying the beginner level or the 'challenge mode', as the other difficulties was made by AI to save time, and flaws are quite easy to spot. They were meant to be remade by us but we never got time unfortunately.
